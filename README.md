# Languageless Angular

This is a small project where I'm attempting to build a frontend app 
using Angular.JS version 1 only to show and learn how the framework
is completely language stack independent.

## Technologies:

Angular.JS 1
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

## How to set up:

Clone the repository in a suitable place in your computer

ex. `C:/Users/User/Code` if you're on windows or `~/Code` if your on a *nix system *(that includes OSX)*

	git clone https://github.com/EvelinFoxell/LanguagelessAngular1.git

Right-click the index.html file in project root and open it with a browser of your choice.
